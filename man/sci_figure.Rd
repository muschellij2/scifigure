\title{Create a figure depicting reproducibility/replicability of a set of
scientific experiments}
\usage{
sci_figure(experiments, hide_stages = NULL, names_of_stages = TRUE,
  diff = FALSE, showlegend = TRUE, cols = c("#D20000", "#007888",
  "#CDCDCD", "black"), leg_text = c("Incorrect", "Different", "Unobserved",
  "Original"))
}
\arguments{
\item{experiments}{A data frame, which can be initialized with \code{init_experiments()},
whose rownames are the predefined stages of a scientifc experiments, columnnames are
the names of each experiment, and cell values represent the state of each stage
in each experiment (states discussed below).}

\item{hide_stages}{(optional) A character vector with the names of the stages
in the scientific experiment, i.e. rownames of \code{experiments}, which the user wishes
to suppress from the figure output. The default value of \code{hide_stages} is NULL, indicating
that all stages will be displayed.}

\item{names_of_stages}{Logical indicating whether or not the names of the
stages should be displayed.}

\item{diff}{(optional) A Boolean flag to indicate whether the rendering of the figure should
emphasize the differences between the experiments ("difference mode"). The difference mode uses
a set of four symbols that are semantically close to the scenarios that they are encoding.
The default value is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{showlegend}{Do you want the legend to be shown?}

\item{cols}{colors to use for the specific scenarios}

\item{leg_text}{text for legend keys corresponding to the specific colors.}
}
\description{
\code{sci_figure} creates a graphical representation of changes in a
a set of subsequent studies or reproduction attempts as compared to an
original study.
}
\note{
For the parameter \code{experiments}, the four values any cell may take
are: \code{observed}, \code{different}, \code{unobserved}, \code{incorrect}.

# Initialize the default experiments data frame
exps <- init_experiments()

experiments = exps
experiments["analyst", "Exp2"] <- "different"

# Create the same figure using the difference mode
